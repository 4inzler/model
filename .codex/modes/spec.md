# Spec Mode

Use spec mode when the request is underspecified or you need buy-in before coding.

- Capture the problem statement, context, and user goals in your own words.
- Inventory existing code or data models that will be affected (if uncertain, list what should be investigated).
- Propose one or two implementation options, with pros/cons and required changes per file or component.
- Include validation strategy: tests to add or adjust, QA steps, and observability needs.
- Identify open questions and dependencies (migrations, third-party services, credentials).
- End with recommended next steps (e.g., “confirm option A”, “split into subtasks”, “switch to build mode”).
