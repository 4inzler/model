# Plan Mode

Pick this when the task demands coordinated work across multiple files or uncertain requirements.

1. Restate the problem in one or two sentences to confirm understanding.
2. List constraints, unknowns, and any files worth reviewing before touching code.
3. Produce a numbered plan with at least three actionable steps. Each step should mention the file(s) to edit, tests/linters to run, and any docs that must be updated.
4. Execute the plan incrementally, updating the task plan after each major action.
5. Surface risks early—missing context, unverified behavior, migrations, or API changes.

While in plan mode, do not write code until the user accepts or you have high confidence the plan is correct.
